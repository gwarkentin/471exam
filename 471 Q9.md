1. Given the message = 110101 and the CRC generator polynomial = 101

Enter the binary pattern of the entire message to be transmitted 
which consists of bits of the original message concated with the CRC bits (no blank space)

101    110101

# has 3, so shift left 2

101    11010100
       101
        111          # XOR and drop one down 
        101
         100
         101
           110
            110
            101
             11

11010111

Just do it, it becomes straightforward. Also drop down 3 numbers total (can't be leading 0)
101  
      11010100
      101
       111
       101
        100
        101
          110
          101
           110
           101
            11
      11010111
